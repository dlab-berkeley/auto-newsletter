# auto-newsletter
Automating the creation of the newsletter.

## Goals
The goal is to create a set of scripts that automatically generates the weekly newsletter based on information from the D-Lab website. The scripts should:
* pull the upcoming training information for a given date range
- title
- date
- instructor
- indicate whether or not registration is full
* create an HTML document with the scraped information embedded
